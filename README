In order, to use the differents elements of our OCR you have to
build an exe in the concern folder and you just have to load it
with an image in argument for the preprocessing and the segmentation
and with a number for the neural network.


Now if you want to have an interface with buttons link you have
to follow this steps:


1) First of all build the exe of the differents part of our OCR.
2) Then create the exe gui  in interface folder.
3) After that move the all.c to the root and build the exe.
3) Move gui.exe into the root of our project and load gui.
